            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta </li>   
                    <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil </li>
                    <li>1 onion, sliced </li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary </li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
                    <li>½ pound ground beef </li>
                    <li>½ pound ground pork sausage </li>
                    <li>1 ½ (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce </li>
                    <li>salt to taste </li>
                    <li>1 (6 ounce) package provolone cheese, sliced </li>
                    <li>¾ cup sour cream </li>
                    <li>¾ cup cottage cheese </li>
                    <li>1 (6 ounce) package mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>

                </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until tender. Stir in rosemary and garlic. Transfer to a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Place ground beef and sausage in the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Stir in the onion mixture and the spaghetti sauce. Season with salt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In the prepared dish, layer 1/2 of the cooked pasta, provolone cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, and a little less than 1/2 of the meat mixture. Then layer the rest of the pasta, mozzarella cheese, remaining meat mixture, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until heated through and cheeses are melted.</li>

                    
                </ol>
