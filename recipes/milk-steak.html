                <p>Rumour has it “Milk Steak” made its way into the script after someone in the writer’s room misheard “milkshake” and they thought it was hilarious. Diehard fans of the show loved the idea, and many have since tried to recreate it themselves. Charlie orders his Milk Steak with a side of raw jelly beans, which has become the classic way to serve this meal.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>While boiling is a less popular way to cook steak, it helps to cook the meat evenly with more flavor. Charlie prefers his Milk Steak boiled “over hard”, but the general consensus seems to be it isn’t the most appetizing way to enjoy your meat. This recipe will let you experience the infamous Milk Steak in a way that’s more palatable</p>
